# Libft
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/score-125%2F100-brightgreen)

This is the first project of School 42's common core. The students are asked to create a library containing a few dozens of functions to be used on subsequent projects. Some of those functions, mimicking the functionality of C's standard library functions, had already been used extensively during the Piscine, while others introduced new concepts, such as linked list manipulation.

The goal is for the student to rely on this library for the next projects instead of using the standard library, while tweaking it acording to the projects' necessities.

To use libft in a project, simply compile the library first using `make`, then include the executable libft.a in the project's compilation process.
