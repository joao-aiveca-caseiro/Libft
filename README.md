# Libft
This is the first project of School 42's common core. The students are asked to create a library containing a few dozens of functions to be used on subsequent projects. Some of those functions, mimicking the functionality of C's standard library functions, had already been used extensively during the Piscine, while others introduced new concepts, such as linked list manipulation.

The goal is for the student to rely on these functions for the next projects, instead of using their standard library equivalents, while tweaking them acording to the projects' necessities.
